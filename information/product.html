                <p>Rice is a food crop that is an essential part of a meal worldwide. It is used for making desserts, puddings, or ground rice flour. The rice plant is a member of the grass family called Poaceae. It is cultivated as an agricultural crop with an annual yield of 535 million tons. In Asia alone, over 300 million acres of land are used to grow rice.</p>

                <p>Pesticides are indispensable in agricultural production. They have been used by farmers to control weeds and insects, and their remarkable increases in agricultural products have been reported. The increase in the world’s population in the 20th century could not have been possible without a parallel increase in food production. About one-third of agricultural products are produced depending on the application of pesticides.</p>

                <h3>Milk Farming</h3>
                <p>Dairy farming is a class of agriculture for the long-term production of milk, which is processed (either on the farm or at a dairy plant, either of which may be called a dairy) for the eventual sale of a dairy product. Dairy farming has a history that goes back to the early Neolithic era, around the seventh millennium BC, in many regions of Europe and Africa. Before the 20th century, milking was done by hand on small farms.</p>

                <p>Insecticides are chemicals used to control insects by killing them or preventing them from engaging in undesirable or destructive behaviors. They are classified based on their structure and mode of action.

                    Many insecticides act upon the insect's nervous system (e.g., cholinesterase inhibition), while others act as growth regulators or endotoxins.</p>

                <h3>Impact Of Rain </h3>
                <p>Rainfall is one of the primary factors affecting soil erosion and crop production under rain-fed agriculture. The review sought to quantify the effect of rainfall or moisture on crop production. The Rainfall distribution, amount and intensity as well as rain fall season was reviewed in relation to crop growth and development response., As research show the effect of drought on barley showed that, during the vegetative stage, water stress primarily reduced yields by a reduction in light interception arising from smaller leaves. However, for stress during the grain filling phase, yields were reduced almost equally by reduced photosynthesis per unit area arising from leaf senescence</p>

                <p>Fish farming or pisciculture involves commercial breeding of fish, most often for food, in fish tanks or artificial enclosures such as fish ponds. It is a particular type of aquaculture, which is the controlled cultivation and harvesting of aquatic animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and so on, in natural or pseudo-natural environments. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery. Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, catfish, salmon and tilapia</p>
